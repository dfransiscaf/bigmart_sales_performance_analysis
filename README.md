# BigMart Sales Performance Analysis



## Project Background

BigMart is a global retail corporation managing a diverse portfolio of over 1,500+ products across multiple cities. Since its inception in 2011, the company has scaled its operations to handle a high volume of transactions, successfully generating over $1.2M in total sales revenue across its outlet network.

This project analyzes 7,000+ transaction records to evaluate store performance and consumer buying patterns. The primary objective was to transform raw data into a dynamic sales dashboard, enabling management to make faster, data-driven decisions regarding product performance and outlet efficiency.

The analysis focuses on the following key areas:
- Sales by Outlet Type & Size: Evaluated revenue contributions across different store formats.
- Product Performance: Identified top-performing item categories to optimize stock levels.
- Historical Performance: Analyzed sales trends based on the outlet's establishment year.
- Geographical Analysis: Compared sales performance across different city tiers.



## Data Structure & Initial Checks

The BigMart dataset consists of two primary tables that provide a holistic view of a digital retail business, including:

Product Table
- Item Fat Content: Whether the product is low fat or regular.
- Item Type: The category to which the product belongs.
- Item Visibility: The percentage of total display area of all products in a store allocated to the particular product.
- Item Weight: Weight of the product.
- Sales: Total sales revenue generated by the product.
- Rating: Customer satisfaction score for the product.

Outlet Table
- Outlet Identifier: Unique ID assigned to each store.
- Outlet Establishment Year: The year the store was opened.
- Outlet Location Type: The tier of the city where the store is located.
- Outlet Size: The size of the store in terms of ground area covered.
- Outlet Type: The classification of the outlet.

Conducted a thorough audit of the raw dataset and performed the following cleaning steps to ensure data integrity:
- **Handling Missing Values:** Performed Mean Imputation to fill gaps in numerical data, ensuring a complete dataset for analysis.
- **Handling Inconsistent Values:** Standardized categorical data by mapping coded values into user-friendly descriptions.
- **Removing Duplicates:** Identified and removed redundant records to ensure each entity is uniquely represented.
- **Removing Unwanted Spaces:** Trimmed unnecessary leading and trailing spaces to maintain data uniformity and prevent errors all records.

## Executive Summary

### Overview of Findings

This dashboard provides a comprehensive analysis of BigMart’s sales performance, monitoring core KPIs such as Total Revenue, Average Sales per Outlet, and Product Performance. By transforming raw retail data into interactive visualizations, this project tracks sales distribution across various outlet types and city tiers to identify high-growth locations.

The analysis is designed to pinpoint top-performing product categories and evaluate how store characteristics such as size and establishment year impact overall business health. These insights provide a clear view of operational efficiency and help identify key drivers behind BigMart's sales success.

## Insights Deep Dive
### Sales by Outlet Type and Size

<p align="center">

</p>

####

* Based on the chart, Supermarket Type1 is the strongest contributor to total sales, generating 787,550, or around 65.5% of total sales across all outlet types.
* On the other hand, the other outlet types contribute to only one outlet size, either medium or small, resulting in smaller shares of 10.9%, 10.9%, and 12.6%, respectively.
* This indicates that Supermarket Type1 is a key driver of overall performance and should be further strengthened. Meanwhile, enhancing sales strategies in other outlet types could unlock additional growth potential.

### Sales by Item Type

</p>
  
####

* Among all item types, Fruits and Vegetables recorded the highest sales of 178,124, contributing around 14.8% of total sales. In contrast, Seafood had the lowest sales, only 9,078 or about 0.8% of total sales.
* This shows a significant gap between top- and low-performing categories, suggesting that popular categories like Fruits and Vegetables drive most of the sales, while less popular ones such as Seafood have limited demand or distribution.

####

### Sales Trend by Establishment Year

</p>

#####

* Overall, the sales trend shows relatively consistent performance from 2011 to 2017. However, there was a noticeable spike in 2018, when sales reached 204,522. After 2018, sales slightly declined and stabilized in the following years. While 2018 marked the highest sales, 2011 recorded the lowest at just 78,132.
* This indicates that 2018 was an exceptional year, possibly due to successful promotions, new outlet openings, or favorable market conditions. It suggests that the company should identify the factors that contributed to the 2018 sales spike, as replicating those strategies could help boost future performance and maintain consistent sales growth.

### Outlet Location Analysis

</p>

#####

* Based on the data, Tier 3 outlets recorded the highest total sales at 472,133, followed by Tier 2 with 393,151 and Tier 1 with 336,398. This indicates that outlets located in Tier 3 areas outperform those in higher tiers, possibly due to higher demand, better customer reach, or stronger local market engagement.
* To maximize overall performance, the company could explore what drives Tier 3’s strong results and apply similar strategies to Tier 1 and Tier 2 outlets to balance sales performance across all regions.


#####

## Recommendations:

Based on the insights and findings above, we would recommend that the stakeholder team consider the following: 

* Strengthen Supermarket Type 1 performance and enhance sales strategies in other outlet types to unlock additional growth potential
* Ensure sufficient stock for high-demand items and implement targeted strategies, including marketing and promotions, to improve lower-performing categories
* Identify the key factors that contributed to the 2018 sales spike and replicate them to sustain consistent future growth
* Analyze the success factors behind Tier 3 outlets and apply similar approaches to Tier 1 and Tier 2 outlets to achieve a more balanced regional performance


## Assumptions and Caveats:

Throughout the analysis, several assumptions were made to address data challenges and ensure accuracy. These assumptions and caveats are noted below:
* Missing values in Item Weight were handled using mean and mode imputation respectively, assuming these values represent the general distribution of the data.
* As this is a synthetic dataset for a case study, the analysis assumes that the recorded transactions are representative of actual retail patterns during the established timeframe.
