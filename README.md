# BigMart Sales Performance Analysis



## Project Background

BigMart is a global retail corporation managing a diverse portfolio of over 1,500+ products across multiple cities. Since its inception in 2011, the company has scaled its operations to handle a high volume of transactions, successfully generating over $1.2M in total sales revenue across its outlet network.

This project focuses on analyzing 7,000+ transaction records to evaluate store performance and consumer buying patterns. The primary objective was to transform raw data into a dynamic sales dashboard, enabling management to make faster, data-driven decisions regarding product performance and outlet efficiency.

The analysis focuses on the following key areas:
- Sales by Outlet Type & Size: Evaluated revenue contributions across different store formats.
- Product Performance: Identified top-performing item categories to optimize stock levels.
- Historical Performance: Analyzed sales trends based on the outlet's establishment year.
- Geographical Analysis: Compared sales performance across different city tiers (Tier 1, 2, and 3).



## Data Structure & Initial Checks

The BigMart dataset consists of two primary tables that provide a holistic view of a digital retail business, including:
Product Table
- Item Fat Content: Whether the product is low fat or regular.
- Item Type: The category to which the product belongs.
- Item Visibility: The percentage of total display area of all products in a store allocated to the particular product.
- Item Weight: Weight of the product.
- Sales: Total sales revenue generated by the product.
- Rating: Customer satisfaction score for the product.
Outlet Table
- Outlet Identifier: Unique ID assigned to each store.
- Outlet Establishment Year: The year the store was opened.
- Outlet Location Type: The tier of the city where the store is located.
- Outlet Size: The size of the store in terms of ground area covered.
- Outlet Type: The classification of the outlet.

Initial Data Audit 
Conducted an initial data audit on the raw dataset and found several issues that required cleaning:
- **Handling Missing Values:** fills in the blanks by adding a default value using mean inputation.
- **Handling Inconsistent Values:** Mapping coded values to user-friendly descriptions.
- **Remove Duplicates:** Ensure only one record per entity by identifying and retaining the most relevant row.
- **Remove Unwanted Spaces:** Remove unnecessary spaces to ensure data consistency and uniformity across all records.
Initial Data Audit
Conducted a thorough audit of the raw dataset and performed the following cleaning steps to ensure data integrity:
- **Handling Missing Values:** Performed Mean Imputation to fill gaps in numerical data, ensuring a complete dataset for analysis.
- **Handling Inconsistent Values:** Standardized categorical data by mapping coded values into user-friendly descriptions.
- **Removing Duplicates:** Identified and removed redundant records to ensure each entity is uniquely represented.
- **Removing Unwanted Spaces:** Trimmed unnecessary leading and trailing spaces to maintain data uniformity and prevent errors during data joining or filtering.

#### **1. Revenue Growth and Market Dominance**
* Sales grew consistently throughout 2025, with China emerging as the primary market leader.
* December recorded the highest growth, with a 20,14% increase compared to the previous month, marking it the best-performing period of the year.

#### **2. Quarterly Insights and Seasonal Trends**
* The fourth quarter showed exceptional performance, driven by seasonal shopping trends and year-end marketing campaigns. Outerwear and Coats were identified as the top-performing categories during this period.
* Conversely, revenue experienced a slight 3.73% dip in February, identifying it as a period that requires further strategic attention compared to the year-end surge.

#### **3. Strategic Recommendations**
* Leverage the strong brand presence in China by developing more localized marketing campaigns to further solidify market share in the APAC region.
* To sustain momentum during peak seasons (like Q4), implement targeted loyalty programs focusing on high-performing categories such as Outerwear.
* Investigate the February slump to identify external factors (competition/market shifts) and reassess pricing and promotion strategies to regain momentum earlier in the year.

## Insights Deep Dive
### Revenue & Transaction Value

<img width="1199" height="599" alt="2  thelook sales trend" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/a99a81ff-ad69-40cb-b835-eace0fa133cb" />

#### **1. Total Sales**
* Total sales showed an overall upward trajectory, finishing the year with a strong surge despite minor fluctuations in the first half.
* December emerged as the strongest month with $132.706 in sales and 1.526 unique buyers, likely driven by holiday shopping. On the other hand, February recorded the lowest performance with $58,970 in sales from 684 unique buyers.
* The average monthly sales for the year stood at $82.205.

#### **2. Average Order Value (AOV)**
* The Average Order Value (AOV) remained relatively stable throughout the year, with only minor fluctuations around the $59.05 average.
* The value peaked in July at $61.20 and saw its lowest point in January at $55.24, indicating consistent customer spending behavior despite changes in total sales volume. 

#### **3. Number of Orders**
* Order volume closely follows sales trends, confirming that revenue growth is primarily driven by an increase in transaction count rather than just higher pricing.
* December reached a peak of 2.180 orders, while February remained the lowest with 998 orders. The monthly average for the year was 1.385,5 orders.
* Despite initial fluctuations in the first half of the year, the business gained significant momentum in the later months. With AOV remaining stable, this growth was primarily driven by a surge in order volume during the peak season.

####

* The monthly AOV indicates a stable basket size throughout the year, suggesting consistent consumer spending. However, a deep dive into the Price Delta reveals specific "high-ticket" items within certain categories.
* For instance, the Shorts category contains a significant outlier. The 'Alpha Industries Rip Short' priced at $999, which is $953 above the category average of $46. Similarly, the Outerwear & Coats category features premium items such as 'The North Face Denali Down Women's Jacket' retailing at $903, representing a price delta of $757 compared to the $146 category average. These extreme outliers warrant further investigation to determine if they represent a high-end niche segment or potential data entry errors

### Conversion & Funnel Efficiency 

<img width="1199" height="599" alt="4  thelook category" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/3d0fb7a8-4d5a-4985-b098-7320e059268f" />

####

* Outerwear & Coats consistently led sales over the year, exceeding $116,405 with 819 orders. This suggests a premium pricing strategy, as it generates the highest revenue despite having fewer orders than other top categories.
* Jeans and Sweaters secured the second and third positions, generating $114,783 (1,141 orders) and $78,353 (1,057 orders) respectively, showing strong market demand.
* Clothing Sets recorded the lowest performance with only $2,034 in revenue and 23 orders, indicating a potential need for assortment review or marketing focus.
* In terms of transaction frequency, Intimates outperformed all other categories with 1,245 orders, despite not breaking into the Top 10 by revenue. This indicates a high-volume, low-margin product profile.

####

<img width="1199" height="599" alt="5  thelook first repeat" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/23050db3-e2c3-46d5-8fa1-6318fb63f015" />

####

* The AOV for first-time orders shows a near-linear trend, holding steady between $56 and $61. This suggests a predictable spending pattern for new users that remains largely unaffected by seasonal shifts.
* In contrast, repeat customers exhibited higher volatility, with a notable peak in February at $93.05 followed by several sharp dips. Despite the fluctuations, repeat customers historically spend significantly more per transaction than first-time buyers.
* The data confirms that loyalty drives value; existing customers are willing to commit to larger basket sizes over time. This trend reinforces the importance of retention strategies as a primary driver for increasing revenue per user.

####

<img width="1199" height="599" alt="6  thelook channel" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/ad3948a4-9461-45c9-bfee-79eb002ba1b6" />

#####

* Search is the primary acquisition channel, contributing over $586,365 in total annual sales. This dominance suggests strong brand equity, where customers are actively looking for the brand, leading to high-intent purchases.
* With a consistent average contribution, the Search channel proves to be the most mature and dependable source of income for the platform.
* Looking at the lower end, Display recorded the bottom performance at $32,402 in total sales. This significant gap suggests that display-based advertising is currently less effective at driving direct conversions, presenting an opportunity to either re-evaluate the ad creative or reallocate the budget to higher-performing channels.
* "The Other category represents a significant portion of revenue, which can be attributed to Direct Traffic and non-tracked referrals. While this indicates strong organic brand recall, where customers navigate directly to the platform, it also highlights an opportunity to refine our attribution modeling to better identify these high-performing traffic sources.

### Market Level Retention

<img width="1199" height="599" alt="7  thelook market level" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/c9c86407-3bb6-4336-af30-945b480fd828" />

#####

* Across all primary markets, China recorded the highest volume of churned users (24,570 users), representing an 86.37% churn rate. This high volume is closely followed by the United States (86.12%) and Brasil (86.32%), indicating a common challenge in long-term retention across major regions.
* Despite the high churn volume, China maintains its position as the market leader in engagement, holding the highest percentage of Active (5.79%) and Warm (7.85%) users.
* Similar patterns are observed in Brasil and the United States. Brasil slightly outperforms other major regions with a 5.49% Active and 8.19% Warm user base, while the United States follows closely with 5.64% Active and 8.24% Warm users.
* At the opposite end of the spectrum, countries like Austria and Colombia exhibit the lowest engagement levels, though these figures are skewed by small sample sizes. Austria reflects a 100% churn rate from a single user, while Colombia’s 8 users are all classified as churned, leaving the region with zero active or warm customers. These markets remain underdeveloped, indicating that current brand presence is negligible and would require a foundational market-entry strategy rather than a standard retention campaign.

### Category Return Performance

<img width="1199" height="599" alt="8  thelook return" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/acf6d957-5fcf-4fe8-98b9-3fde633cb4e8" />

#####

* Pants recorded the highest return rate at 11.28%, followed by Blazers & Jackets (11.1%) and Outerwear & Coats (10.91%). This indicates a higher dissatisfaction or sizing mismatch in these specific categories throughout the year.
* Initimates dominated the sales volume with 1,245 orders. However, the high transaction count also led to a significant volume of returns (478 items). This suggests that even a standard return percentage in high-volume segments can create a heavy operational burden, necessitating more precise size guides.
* In contrast, Jumpsuits & Rompers and Underwear proved to be the most reliable products with the lowest return rates at 6.54% and 8.59%, respectively.
* However, the low return rate for Jumpsuits & Rompers is also correlated with its low sales volume, as it ranks at the bottom of the total purchase orders. This suggests that while the product is rarely returned, it also has the lowest market demand.

## Recommendations:

Based on the insights and findings above, we would recommend that the stakeholder team consider the following: 

#### **1. Revenue & Transaction Value** 
* Address the sales dip in February by launching targeted marketing campaigns to maintain momentum during low-season periods.
* Evaluate high-priced outliers in premium categories to ensure pricing aligns with market expectations and doesn't deter conversion.
* Re-engage lost customers through personalized remarketing or adjusted pricing strategies specifically designed for returning users.

#### **2. Conversion & Funnel Efficiency**
* Optimize inventory levels for high-performing categories (Outerwear & Coats, Jeans, and Sweaters) while deprioritizing low-demand items like Clothing Sets.
* Leverage the high volume of Intimates (over 1,000 orders) as a gateway for cross-selling or bundling with high-margin items.
* Implement a VIP/Loyalty Program for repeat customers to stabilize their spending volatility and capitalize on their high AOV potential.
* Double down on the high-performing Search channel to capture existing demand, while re-evaluating the Display ads budget to find more cost-effective ways of acquiring new customers to ensure a healthy long-term sales funnel.

#### **3. Market Level Retention**
* Maintain China’s market leadership by implementing country-specific retention strategies to mitigate the high churn volume while sustaining its massive active user base.
* Conduct a market re-evaluation for Austria and Colombia. Given the small user base and high churn rate in Colombia, the focus should shift from simple expansion to identifying product-market fit or testing localized marketing campaigns to establish a viable initial foothold.

#### **4. Category Return Performance**
* Review category with return rates >10% by improving size guides and product descriptions to prevent revenue loss.
* Strengthen quality control across all categories and for high-priced items, as frequent returns on these products significantly increase operational costs and hurt net profit.


## Assumptions and Caveats:

Throughout the analysis, several assumptions were made to address data challenges and ensure accuracy. These assumptions and caveats are noted below:
* Duplicate records identified within the email data were removed to ensure only one unique record per customer entity, retaining the most relevant data point.
* To maintain data integrity, missing values in Brand Name and Product Name were imputed with default values: 'Unknown_Brand' and 'Unnamed Product', respectively.
* Significant price outliers were identified in specific categories with the highest price deltas. These were kept in the analysis but warrant further investigation to determine whether they represent luxury, high-margin items or data entry errors.
* Return rates for the most recent period may be subject to change, as the standard 30-day return window may not have fully closed.
* All financial metrics are analyzed in USD and do not account for global currency fluctuations in international markets.
